# Contributor License Agreement

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with
contributions from any person or entity, this project must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
agreed to by each Contributor. This license is for your protection as a contributor 
as well as the protection of the project's and it's maintainers; it does not change
your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose. 

Either individuals or business entities, including without limitation, 
all employees or agents acting on behalf of such entity (an "Entity"), 
may submit contributions under the terms of this agreement.  

### PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE AGREEING TO IT!

You accept and agree that UNLESS OTHERWISE GOVERNED BY A **WRITTEN** LICENSE AGREEMENT
that ALL CONTRIBUTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED and
YOUR PRESENT AND FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS are licensed under the terms
of the project's representative license.

If the project does not have a `LICENSE` file or any kind of equivalent like a homepage
that states the license or a customized CLA for some reason, [The Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) automatically applies.

This decision was made to clarify what users may and may not do if a repository has seemingly no license.

For your convenience a copy of the applicable Unlicense version is included below:
